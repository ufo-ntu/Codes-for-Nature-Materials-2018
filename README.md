RemoveBackgroundSignal&AnalyzeAttenuation:
    AnalyzeAttenuation_sample1.m: remove background signal and analyze acoustic attenuation (P3/P1) measured from sample 1. 
    AnalyzeAttenuation_sample2.m: remove background signal and analyze acoustic attenuation (P3/P1) measured from sample 2. 
    SimulationFitting_sample1.m: function of fitting for sample 1. fitting the background curve to extract acoustic signal. 
    SimulationFitting_sample2.m: function of fitting for sample 2. fitting the background curve to extract acoustic signal.

CalculateIntrinsicPhononLifetime&ErrorPropagation: calculate intrinsic phonon lifetime by comparing with low temperature attenuation. error bar is calculated by error propagation method.
    CalculateIntrinsicPhononLifetime_sample1.m: for sample 1
    CalculateIntrinsicPhononLifetime_sample2.m: for sample 2
    
SimulationofAcousticSignal.m: calculate the simulation of A1 and A3 acoustic signals
